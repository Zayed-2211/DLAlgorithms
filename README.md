# Neural Networks and Autoencoders

This repository contains two Jupyter notebooks:

1. **Neural Network Implementation from Scratch**: This notebook contains a detailed implementation of a neural network from scratch. It includes the mathematical concepts behind neural networks and a step-by-step guide on how to implement them.

2. **Autoencoders using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**: This notebook demonstrates how to implement autoencoders using CNNs. It provides a comprehensive guide on how to build, train, and evaluate autoencoders.
